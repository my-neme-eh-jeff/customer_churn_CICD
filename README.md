# ML Deployment System for Autoresearch

Drop in a binary-classification CSV, declare its schema, and an LLM iteratively proposes code changes, trains them on Kubernetes, and ships the winners to production via GitOps.

**No human in the loop.**

---

### For non-technical readers

A system that improves an ML model on its own.

- Claude proposes a small change.
- The system trains a new model.
- If it scores better, the new model goes live automatically.
- If it scores worse, the change is discarded and the loop tries something else.

### For technical readers

- A Kubeflow Pipelines run trains and evaluates each candidate on GKE.
- If AUC beats the current `@champion` alias in MLflow by ≥ `min_improvement` (configurable in `configs/params.yaml`, currently 0.003 — roughly one standard error of AUC on a 40K-row test set), the autoresearch loop bumps an annotation in `k8s/` and pushes via a GitHub App.
- ArgoCD reconciles, the inference Deployment rolls, new pods re-read `models:/classifier@champion` from MLflow at startup.
- Failed candidates never edit the annotation. The live model can't get worse than the last champion that won.
- Dataset is plug-and-play through `configs/params.yaml`. No code knows the column names.

▶ **[Watch the 3:30 demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/O0uPoLO-2JM)** — submit a run → KFP trains on GKE → MLflow logs and registers `v_N` → signed PR via GitHub App → ArgoCD reconciles → `curl /predict` returns the new model version. Closes with the AUC trajectory across the overnight loop: baseline **0.749 → champion 0.9344** across 12 evaluated candidates.

### What's deployed

Four artifact stores. All four must be healthy or the loop stalls.

| # | Artifact | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `@champion` alias on `classifier` | MLflow + CloudSQL |
| 2 | Inference image | `ghcr.io/<user>/inference-api` |
| 3 | KFP base image | `ghcr.io/<user>/pipeline-kfp` |
| 4 | Autoresearch image | `ghcr.io/<user>/autoresearch` |

## 🤖 The autoresearch loop

Inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Job as Autoresearch Job
    participant Claude
    participant KFP as Kubeflow Pipelines
    participant MLflow
    participant GH as GitHub App
    participant Argo as ArgoCD
    participant Pods as Inference Pods

    Job->>Claude: code, params, history
    Claude-->>Job: ONE proposed change
    Job->>KFP: submit pipeline run
    KFP->>MLflow: log run, register vN
    KFP->>MLflow: compare AUC vs @champion

    alt AUC better
        MLflow-->>KFP: set @champion = vN
        Job->>GH: bump deployment annotation
        GH-->>Argo: poll detects change
        Argo->>Pods: rolling restart
        Pods->>MLflow: load @champion
        Pods-->>Job: now serving vN
    else AUC worse or equal
        MLflow-->>KFP: @champion unchanged
        Job->>Job: revert + log to history
    end
```

### Why promotion is a chain, not one API call

Setting `@champion` in MLflow alone changes nothing live. Pods loaded their model at startup and hold it in memory.

The annotation bump in `k8s/deployment.yaml` is what triggers the rolling restart. New pods then read `@champion` again at startup. Failed iterations never touch the annotation, so the live model **can't get worse, only different**.

### Who does what

| Actor | Owns | Does NOT |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude** | Propose one change per iter | Touch the cluster |
| **Autoresearch Job** | Apply, submit KFP, commit | Train or evaluate |
| **KFP** | Train + evaluate on GKE | Trigger deploys |
| **MLflow** | Runs, metrics, `@champion` | Restart pods |
| **ArgoCD** | Reconcile cluster to git | Know about models |

```bash
make auto-experiment-dry-run                                  # preview
make autoresearch-run AUTORESEARCH_N=20 AUTORESEARCH_HOURS=2  # real run
```

## 🧪 Pipeline stages

Defined in `pipelines/pipeline.py`:

| Stage | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **preprocess** | `train.csv`, `test.csv` | Reads schema from `params.yaml`, stratified 80/20 split |
| **train** | `classifier.pkl`, `run_id.txt` | sklearn `Pipeline` (Scaler + OHE + estimator), logged to MLflow |
| **evaluate** | `metrics.json` | Sets `@champion` if AUC beats current by ≥ `min_improvement` |

DVC handles data versioning only. Each `data/*.dvc` is a pointer in git, blob in GCS. KFP is the pipeline runner.

### Plug-and-play schema

Swap datasets by replacing this block in `configs/params.yaml`:

```yaml
dataset:
  csv_path: data/ieee_cis.parquet
  target_column: isFraud
  drop_columns: [TransactionID, TransactionDT]
  numeric_features: [TransactionAmt]
  categorical_features: [ProductCD]

train:
  model_type: DecisionTreeClassifier   # deliberately weak starting point
  max_depth: null
  max_features: null
```

The starting point is deliberately weak: vanilla decision tree on a 2-feature subset. A strong baseline would make the loop a no-op — the climb is the point.

## 🏁 Spin it up

First-time setup is a single interactive wizard — pick cloud, paste in creds, done:

```bash
make setup                                     # interactive: cloud + tracker + creds → .env
```

Then the four-command demo flow:

```bash
make cluster-wake                              # bring up GKE + CloudSQL + KFP + ArgoCD
make reset-for-fresh-run                       # baseline classifier@v1 (vanilla DT)
make autoresearch-run AUTORESEARCH_N=20        # let Claude iterate 20×
make cluster-sleep                             # tear down to ~$0/day idle
```

You'll need a GCP project, an Anthropic API key, and a GitHub App PEM in GCP Secret Manager. The setup wizard prompts for all of these.

For local dev:

```bash
uv sync                              # install
uv run dvc pull                      # pull dataset from GCS
make test                            # run pytest
make mlflow-kill && make mlflow      # port-forward GKE MLflow
make serve                           # local API → POST /predict
```

## 🔁 GitOps: why ArgoCD, why not Helm

Raw YAML manifests + ArgoCD. No Helm, no Kustomize.

ArgoCD reconciles `k8s/` against the live cluster every ~3 minutes. Git is the source of truth for what's deployed.

| Format | Earns its keep when | Used here |
|---|---|---|
| Raw YAML | Small apps, one environment | ✅ 4 files in `k8s/` |
| Helm | Many envs (dev/staging/prod) or 10+ services sharing config | ❌ |
| Kustomize | Environment variants | ❌ |

The one-line `sed` in CI that swaps the image tag does the same thing as `helm upgrade --set image.tag=...`. With one cluster and four manifests, a Chart would be more code to maintain than the manifests it replaces.

## ☁️ Infrastructure

| Component | What |
|---|---|
| GKE Autopilot | `mlops-cluster`, `asia-south1` |
| MLflow backend | CloudSQL Postgres 15 |
| MLflow artifacts | GCS bucket |
| DVC remote | GCS bucket |
| Images | `ghcr.io/<user>/{inference-api, pipeline-kfp, autoresearch}` |
| Workload Identity | Pods bind to GCP SAs; no SA keys mounted |
| Secrets | Anthropic key + GitHub App PEM in GCP Secret Manager |

---

## 🛠️ Tools and why

| Tool | Why |
|---|---|
| **MLflow** | Runs, registry, `--serve-artifacts` proxy. `@champion`/`@challenger` aliases give clean promotion semantics. |
| **Kubeflow Pipelines** | K8s-native; each step a container; DAG view built-in. |
| **DVC** | Data versioning. Pointer in git, blob in GCS. *(Not used as a pipeline runner.)* |
| **ArgoCD** | Reconciles cluster to git. Push = deploy. |
| **GitHub Actions** | Lint, test, build images. Path-filtered so docs don't trigger image rebuilds. |
| **GitHub App + GraphQL** | Autoresearch commits are signed and verified. No PAT. |
| **GKE Autopilot** | No node management. Stable LoadBalancer IPs. |
| **CloudSQL** | Survives pod restarts. SQLite-on-PVC didn't; the registry got wiped twice before I swapped backends. |
| **uv + ruff** | Fast Python tooling. |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset** (590K × 433). Telco Churn caps near AUC 0.84; IEEE-CIS gives the loop a real climb.
- **20+ iter autoresearch run** on IEEE-CIS, with the AUC-vs-iteration trajectory plot.
- **Cost plot.** Anthropic tokens per iteration are already logged to MLflow. A Make target turns the history into a `$ spent vs. AUC gained` chart.
- **Argo Rollouts canary.** 10% traffic, abort on `/health` regression, auto-rollback.
- **API auth.** Cloudflare Access or a shared API key. Open right now because the demo URL has to work for whoever clicks it.
- **CI MLflow.** CI uses an ephemeral MLflow today; promotions inside CI hit a throwaway DB. A stable CI-accessible endpoint would close that loop.

### Current scope

Personal portfolio project — not a 5-nines production deployment.

- Single zone. A zone outage takes everything down.
- Free-trial GCP credits, so the public IPs are stable per cluster lifetime but not forever.
- No data-drift monitoring, no auto-retraining triggers. **Autoresearch is the retraining mechanism.**
- Stagnation guard: the loop early-stops after `auto_experiment.max_iterations_without_improvement` consecutive non-improving iters (default 10; counts failed pipelines, sub-threshold reverts, and Claude errors).
- No model-serving benchmarking (TTFT, P99). Separate project.
